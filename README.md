# Forum Frontend

This project is a ReactJS-based frontend for a forum application, styled with Material-UI. It provides a sleek, responsive user interface for forum interactions, including posts, and comments.

ChatGPT was used to create boilerplate, write portions of this README, to debug, and to get the names of types.
